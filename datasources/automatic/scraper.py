######### Implement Scraper here #########

# for each site in sources.csv
# scrape and try to extract fields that are not set in the CSV

# output + usage
# 1. output should be a dataframe, similar to the one used in datasources.META_scraper.py
# 2. writing results to Elasticsearch should be handled in backend
# 3. calling the automatic scraper should be scheduled (in backend?)
